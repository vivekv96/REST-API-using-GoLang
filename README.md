# REST APIs using GoLang
This is a simple project that demonstrates how to create simple REST APIs with the Go programming language.
In this example, a server side "main.go" connects to a MYSQL database and can handle a couple of different types of GET and POST requests.


I will soon be adding a better understandable documentation of the same.
